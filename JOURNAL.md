## 10/6/2025 - research, scehematics, madness, draft 1!  

whoops I forgot to journal my progress, so basically I wanted to make a USB that's multiple USBs at once, using it like:
1. put iso files in the "real" drive
2. select iso file in device
3. iso file appears as the drive contents

for this I need a high-capacity storage and USB HS speeds bare minimum, so I need a microcontroller with a SDMMC peripheral and USB HS. Not a lot of those, so after sifting through a lot I found the STM32U595RI and was designing around it.

unfortunately, after a bit of planning the firmware, I encountered the clockthulu and was nearly driven to madness, so I started looking for an alternative(also it was 13.5$ a piece).

After a bit more digging, I found out about the LPC5526JBD64, which was only around 5$ a piece and seemed to have less outer gods needed for system configuration.

after rewiring, I needed to fit a screen in, which would've required double sided component placement, so I made the thing two pcbs connected via a header and some M2 screws. thus the first draft of UMSwitch(because it's a *U*SB *M*ass *S*torage device that *switch*es between virtual disks) is, uh, done I think?
